                <p>As a Arizona resident the past 25 years, I have been involved in software and database development in my career mainly in the healthcare industry.  Healthcare is very data and process driven.  Accuracy and timely updates are crucial for patient care.  My main development skills include <strong>.Net Visual Studio </strong> environment using <strong>VB.Net</strong> and <strong>C#</strong> object-oriented languages.  The back-end database side Iâ€™ve developed and scripted in <strong>Microsoft SQL Server</strong> writing stored procedures to handle data transactions. Being a database and object-oriented programmer I have acquired analytical and logical skills to translate business needs and workflows to create programmed solutions.

                    Lately, I have decided to do a mid-career change and immerse myself into the web development world. The web is so much part of our lives with internet taking over how we get our information and how to conduct commerce for purchasing goods and services.  I am learning how there are vast amounts of web tools and languages that have created a demand for skilled web developers to know and learn.   I decided to enroll in professional training to learn the latest web application languages and tools.  There is so much to know and learn. I am taking baby steps to apply myself in this whole new career path.  I look forward for this new path in my future career.
